An SRE State of Reliability Report is a formal document or dashboard that provides an end-to-end view of a system’s health, reliability posture, and improvement opportunities. It communicates how well services are performing against their reliability goals—typically structured for both engineering leadership and business stakeholders.

Here’s what it should include:


## 📊 1. Executive Summary

* Objective of the report (e.g., track SLOs, identify reliability risks)
* Timeframe covered (e.g., Q1 2025)
* Key insights (e.g., major outages, improvement from last quarter, high-risk areas)


## 🛠️ 2. Service Overview

For each critical service (or grouped by product area):

* Service Name & Owner
* Tier/Priority (e.g., Tier 1 critical, Tier 3 internal tool)
* Dependencies (internal and external)

## 📏 3. SLI/SLO Performance

* SLIs: Latency, availability, error rate, saturation
* SLO Targets vs. Actuals
* Error Budget Consumption
* % used
* Burn rate
* Trends (graphs of SLO performance over time)
* Highlight:
* SLOs consistently met
* SLOs violated or at risk
* Causes of burn (e.g., regression, dependency failure)

## 🚨 4. Incident Summary

* Incident Volume (by severity: Sev0–Sev3)
* MTTR / MTTD / MTTF metrics
* Top incident causes (root cause categories)
* High-impact incidents:
* Date/time
* Affected services
* Duration
* Impact (users, revenue)
* Lessons learned
* Postmortem Quality (e.g., % completed, blamelessness score)

## 🧯 5. Operational Load & Toil

* On-call metrics:
* Pages per person
* Out-of-hours alerts
* Manual work frequency:
* Deployment steps
* Manual remediation tasks
* SRE time allocation:
* % on toil vs. engineering

## 🧪 6. Testing & Deployment Health

* Deployment frequency
* Rollback rate
* CI/CD reliability
* Test coverage & flakiness

## 🔐 7. Risk Register

* Known risks to reliability:
* Architecture bottlenecks
* Technical debt
* Fragile dependencies
* Mitigation status & owners

## 🚀 8. Reliability Improvement Roadmap

* In-flight initiatives:
* SLO rollout
* Chaos engineering
* Infra scaling
* Planned improvements & investments
* Suggested org/process changes (e.g., on-call rotation redesign, observability upgrades)

## 📈 9. Recommendations

* Strategic calls to action for leadership
* Budget/resource asks
* Policy updates

## ✅ 10. Appendices

* Full SLO definitions
* Incident postmortem index
* Charts and dashboards
